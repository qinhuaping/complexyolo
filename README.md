# Complex-YOLO
Complex-YOLO: Real-time 3D Object Detection on Point Clouds   pytorch

# Introduction
This is an unofficial implementation of Complex-YOLO: Real-time 3D Object Detection on Point Clouds in pytorch. A large part of this project is based on the work here:https://github.com/marvis/pytorch-yolo2


Point Cloud Preprocessing is based on:https://github.com/skyhehe123/VoxelNet-pytorch
